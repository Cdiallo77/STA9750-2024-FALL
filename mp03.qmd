In this project, we’ll explore historical congressional election data to analyze how US presidential election outcomes might differ under alternative allocation rules. While this “retro-diction” exercise has limitations - since different rules could have led to altered campaigns and voting patterns - it aims to provide meaningful insights into potential biases within the electoral system.

## Data : US House Election Votes & Congressional Boundary Files from 1976 to 2022

Downloading the MIT Election Data Science Lab that provides comprehensive data on all biennial congressional races across all 50 states, spanning from 1976 to 2022. I additionally, downloaded statewide presidential vote counts from 1976 to 2022. Plus, Jeffrey B. Lewis, Brandon DeVine, Lincoln Pritcher, and Kenneth C. Martis have created shapefiles for all US congressional districts from 1789 to 2012.

#### Task 1: Downloading congressional shapefiles from Lewis et al. for all US Congresses5 from 1976 to 2012.

```{r}
# Function to download and extract shapefiles
download_shapefiles <- function(year) {
  base_url <- "https://cdmaps.polisci.ucla.edu/shp/districts"
  file_name <- paste0("cd", year, ".zip")
  file_url <- paste0(base_url, "/", file_name)
  dest_file <- paste0("~/STA9750-2024-FALL/", file_name)
  
  # Check if file already exists
  if (!file.exists(dest_file)) {
    # Create directory if it doesn't exist
    if (!dir.exists("~/STA9750-2024-FALL")) {
      dir.create("~/STA9750-2024-FALL", recursive = TRUE)
    }
    
    # Download the file
    GET(file_url, write_disk(dest_file, overwrite = TRUE))
    
    # Unzip the file
    unzip(dest_file, exdir = "~/STA9750-2024-FALL")
  }
}

# Download shapefiles for the years 1976 to 2012
years <- seq(1976, 2012, by = 2)
for (year in years) {
  download_shapefiles(year)
}
```

#### Task 2: Downloading congressional shapefiles from the US Census Bureau for all US Congresses from 2014 to 2022.

```{r}

# Base FTP URL for US Census Bureau Congressional District shapefiles
base_ftp_url <- "https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER"

# Function to download and extract shapefiles
download_shapefiles <- function(year) {
  file_name <- paste0("tl_", year, "_us_cd116.zip")
  file_url <- paste0(base_ftp_url, year, "/CD/", file_name)
  dest_file <- paste0("~/STA9750-2024-FALL/", file_name)
  
  # Check if file already exists
  if (!file.exists(dest_file)) {
    # Create directory if it doesn't exist
    if (!dir.exists("~/STA9750-2024-FALL")) {
      dir.create("~/STA9750-2024-FALL", recursive = TRUE)
    }
    
    # Download the file
    GET(file_url, write_disk(dest_file, overwrite = TRUE))
    
    # Unzip the file
    unzip(dest_file, exdir = "~/STA9750-2024-FALL")
  }
}

# Download shapefiles for the years 2014 to 2022
years <- seq(2014, 2022, by = 2)
for (year in years) {
  download_shapefiles(year)
}
```

#### Task 3: Exploration of Vote Count Data

Answering the following using the vote count data files from the MIT Election Data Science Lab with a plot or a graph.

Which states have gained and lost the most seats in the US House of Representatives between 1976 and 2022 ?

```{r}
# File paths to the manually downloaded files
house_votes_dest <- "~/STA9750-2024-FALL/1976-2022-house.csv"
presidential_votes_dest <- "~/STA9750-2024-FALL/1976-2020-president.csv"

# Load the data
house_votes <- read_csv(house_votes_dest)
presidential_votes <- read_csv(presidential_votes_dest)

```

```{r}
# Summarize the number of seats per state for each election year
seats_by_state <- house_votes %>%
  group_by(year, state) %>%
  summarize(seats = n_distinct(district), .groups = 'drop')

# Calculate the change in seats from 1976 to 2022
seats_change <- seats_by_state %>%
  filter(year %in% c(1976, 2022)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = seats, names_prefix = "year_") %>%
  mutate(change = year_2022 - year_1976) %>%
  arrange(desc(change))
```

```{r}
# Filter the top 10 states with the largest absolute change in seats
top_10_seats_change <- seats_change %>%
  mutate(abs_change = abs(change)) %>%
  arrange(desc(abs_change)) %>%
  slice(1:10)

# Create the heatmap with the top 10 states
ggplot(top_10_seats_change, aes(x = 1, y = reorder(state, change), fill = change)) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "red", high = "green", mid = "white", midpoint = 0) +
  labs(title = "Top 10 States by Change in US House Seats (1976-2022)",
       x = "", y = "State", fill = "Seat Change") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
    axis.text.x = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
    legend.position = "top"
  )

# Display the table of changes
print(seats_change)

```

This Heatmap displays the top 10 states that have lost and gained the most seat from 1976 to 2022. Texas +14, Florida +13, California +9 are among the States that have gained the most seats.

Next, let's address the second question about the impact of New York State's "fusion" voting system. We'll need to identify elections where the outcome would have been different without the fusion system.

The first step is to identify Elections with Fusion Voting. We'll filter the data for New York State and identify elections where candidates appeared on multiple party lines, summarize total votes by candidate and district (including fusion votes). Then, summarize only major party votes (Democrat or Republican lines). After that, merge total votes (fusion) with major party votes to identify the fusion winner and major party-only winner. Last, we will filter to find elections where the outcome would change without fusion votes and display the result.

```{r}
# Inspect column names for house_votes
colnames(house_votes)

# Inspect column names for presidential_votes
colnames(presidential_votes)
```

```{r}

# Step 1: Filter New York State elections
ny_votes <- house_votes %>%
  filter(state == "NY")

# Step 2: 
total_votes <- ny_votes %>%
  group_by(year, district, candidate) %>%
  summarize(fusion_total_votes = sum(candidatevotes), .groups = 'drop')

# Step 3: 
major_party_votes <- ny_votes %>%
  filter(party %in% c("DEMOCRAT", "REPUBLICAN")) %>%
  group_by(year, district, candidate) %>%
  summarize(major_party_total_votes = sum(candidatevotes), .groups = 'drop')

# Step 4: 
election_outcomes <- total_votes %>%
  left_join(major_party_votes, by = c("year", "district", "candidate")) %>%
  mutate(
    major_party_total_votes = replace_na(major_party_total_votes, 0)  # Set to 0 if no major party votes
  )

# Step 5: 
election_outcomes <- election_outcomes %>%
  group_by(year, district) %>%
  mutate(
    winner_fusion = candidate[which.max(fusion_total_votes)],
    winner_major_party = candidate[which.max(major_party_total_votes)]
  ) %>%
  ungroup()

# Step 6: 
different_outcomes <- election_outcomes %>%
  filter(winner_fusion != winner_major_party)

# Display the table of different outcomes
print(different_outcomes)

```

```{r}
# Filter data for New York State
ny_votes <- house_votes %>%
  filter(state == "NY")
# Summarize total votes by candidate and party
candidate_votes <- ny_votes %>%
  group_by(year, district, candidate, party) %>%
  summarize(total_votes = sum(candidatevotes), .groups = 'drop')
# Identify votes from major parties
major_party_votes <- candidate_votes %>%
  filter(party %in% c("DEMOCRAT", "REPUBLICAN")) %>%
  group_by(year, district, candidate) %>%
  summarize(major_party_votes = sum(total_votes), .groups = 'drop')
# Compare total votes with major party votes
election_outcomes <- candidate_votes %>%
  group_by(year, district, candidate) %>%
  summarize(total_votes = sum(total_votes), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  left_join(major_party_votes, by = c("year", "district", "candidate")) %>%
  mutate(major_party_votes = replace_na(major_party_votes, 0)) %>%
  group_by(year, district) %>%
  mutate(winner_total = candidate[which.max(total_votes)],
         winner_major_party = candidate[which(major_party_votes == max(major_party_votes, na.rm = TRUE))]) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(winner_total != winner_major_party)
# Display the table of different outcomes
print(election_outcomes)

```

It seems that the fusion voting system in New York State didn't significantly alter the outcomes of the elections in our data set. This could mean that even without combining votes from multiple party lines, the same candidates would have won. However, let's ensure we've covered all bases. Here's a final approach to verify:

```{r}
# Filter data for New York State
ny_votes <- house_votes %>%
  filter(state == "NY")
# Summarize total votes by candidate and district
total_votes_by_candidate <- ny_votes %>%
  group_by(year, district, candidate) %>%
  summarize(total_votes = sum(candidatevotes, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')
# Summarize major party votes by candidate and district
major_party_votes_by_candidate <- ny_votes %>%
  filter(party %in% c("DEMOCRAT", "REPUBLICAN")) %>%
  group_by(year, district, candidate) %>%
  summarize(major_party_votes = sum(candidatevotes, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')
# Merge total votes and major party votes
merged_votes <- total_votes_by_candidate %>%
  left_join(major_party_votes_by_candidate, by = c("year", "district", "candidate"))

# Identify winners by total votes and major party votes
election_results <- merged_votes %>%
  group_by(year, district) %>%
  mutate(winner_total = candidate[which.max(total_votes)],
         winner_major_party = candidate[which.max(major_party_votes)]) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(winner_total != winner_major_party)
# Display the table of different outcomes
print(election_results)
```

This approach still yields no results, it confirms that the fusion voting system did not alter the election outcomes in our dataset.

For the third question, we'll analyze the data to determine if presidential candidates tend to run ahead of or behind congressional candidates in the same state.

```{r}
# Summarize presidential votes by state and year
pres_votes_by_state <- presidential_votes %>%
  filter(party_simplified == "DEMOCRAT") %>%
  group_by(year, state) %>%
  summarize(pres_votes = sum(candidatevotes), .groups = 'drop')

# Summarize congressional votes by state and year
cong_votes_by_state <- house_votes %>%
  filter(party == "DEMOCRAT") %>%
  group_by(year, state) %>%
  summarize(cong_votes = sum(candidatevotes), .groups = 'drop')
# Compare presidential and congressional votes
votes_comparison <- pres_votes_by_state %>%
  inner_join(cong_votes_by_state, by = c("year", "state")) %>%
  mutate(vote_difference = pres_votes - cong_votes)
# Display the table of vote differences
print(votes_comparison)
```

```{r}

# Create a simplified bar chart
ggplot(votes_comparison, aes(x = reorder(state, vote_difference), y = vote_difference, fill = vote_difference > 0)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("red", "green"), labels = c("Run Behind", "Run Ahead")) +
  labs(title = "Vote Differences Between Presidential and Congressional Candidates (Democratic)",
       x = "State",
       y = "Vote Difference",
       fill = "Vote Difference") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        legend.position = "top")

```

```{r}
# Plot the vote differences
ggplot(votes_comparison, aes(x = year, y = vote_difference, color = state)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Vote Differences Between Presidential and Congressional Candidates",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Vote Difference",
       color = "State") +
  theme_minimal()
```

To analyze whether the trend of presidential candidates running ahead or behind congressional candidates differs over time, across states, or across parties, we need to break down the data further. We will create visualizations and analyses that will help us understand whether the trend of presidential candidates running ahead or behind congressional candidates differs over time, across states, or across parties, and identify any presidents who were particularly more or less popular than their co-partisans.

```{r}
# Summarize votes by state, year, and party
pres_votes_by_state_party <- presidential_votes %>%
  group_by(year, state, party_simplified) %>%
  summarize(pres_votes = sum(candidatevotes), .groups = 'drop')

cong_votes_by_state_party <- house_votes %>%
  group_by(year, state, party) %>%
  summarize(cong_votes = sum(candidatevotes), .groups = 'drop')

# Compare presidential and congressional votes by party
votes_comparison_party <- pres_votes_by_state_party %>%
  inner_join(cong_votes_by_state_party, by = c("year", "state", "party_simplified" = "party")) %>%
  mutate(vote_difference = pres_votes - cong_votes)

# Create a line chart to visualize the trend over time
ggplot(votes_comparison_party, aes(x = year, y = vote_difference, color = party_simplified, group = state)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ party_simplified) +
  labs(title = "Vote Differences Between Presidential and Congressional Candidates Over Time",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Vote Difference",
       color = "Party") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Above is looking at the trend overtime as line chart that shows the vote differences between presidential and congressional candidates have increased or decreased over time. If the vote differences are becoming more positive over time, it suggests that presidential candidates are increasingly running ahead of congressional candidates; this could be due to political shifts, changes in voter behavior, or other factors.

```{r}
# Create a heatmap to visualize vote differences across states
ggplot(votes_comparison_party, aes(x = year, y = state, fill = vote_difference)) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "red", high = "green", mid = "white", midpoint = 0, name = "Vote Difference") +
  labs(title = "Heatmap of Vote Differences Between Presidential and Congressional Candidates Across States",
       x = "Year",
       y = "State") +
  theme_minimal()
```

The heatmap shows how vote differences vary across states. States with consistently high positive or negative vote differences indicate strong trends.

```{r}
# Summarize vote differences by party
votes_comparison_summary <- votes_comparison_party %>%
  group_by(party_simplified) %>%
  summarize(avg_vote_difference = mean(vote_difference), .groups = 'drop')

# Create a bar chart to compare vote differences across parties
ggplot(votes_comparison_summary, aes(x = party_simplified, y = avg_vote_difference, fill = party_simplified)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Average Vote Differences Between Presidential and Congressional Candidates by Party",
       x = "Party",
       y = "Average Vote Difference",
       fill = "Party") +
  theme_minimal()
```

This bar chart compares the vote differences for Democratic and Republican candidates. The Democratic candidates have lower average vote differences than Republican candidates, it suggests that Democratic presidential candidates tend to run behind of their congressional counterparts more often.

```{r}
# Identify presidents who were more or less popular than their co-partisans
president_popularity <- votes_comparison_party %>%
  group_by(year, party_simplified) %>%
  summarize(avg_vote_difference = mean(vote_difference), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_vote_difference))

# Display the table of president popularity
print(president_popularity)
```

#### Pre-Task 4.

This table shows which presidents were more or less popular compared to their co-partisans.

Importing and Plotting Shape File Data

### Comparing the Effects of ECV Allocation Rules

To compare the effects of different Electoral College Vote (ECV) allocation rules, we need to use historical voting data for U.S. presidential elections. Define allocation strategies such that:

-   The candidate with the most votes in a state wins all the state’s ECVs;
-   The candidate with the most votes in each congressional district wins that district’s ECV; The candidate with the most votes statewide wins the state’s at-large ECVs;
-   ECVs are distributed proportionally based on the percentage of the vote each candidate receives in the state;
-   ECVs are distributed proportionally based on the percentage of the national vote each candidate receives;
-   Compare the winning presidential candidate under each strategy with the actual historical winner.

  # District-level results (assuming we have a district_data with `state`, `district`, `candidate`, `votes`, and `ecv`)
  district_results <- district_data %>%
    group_by(state, district) %>%
    summarize(winner = candidate[which.max(votes)], ecv = sum(ecv)) %>%
    ungroup()
  
  # State-level results (for at-large votes)
  state_results <- data %>%
    group_by(state) %>%
    summarize(winner = candidate[which.max(votes)], ecv = sum(ecv)) %>%

# Function for State-Wide Proportional Allocation

    group_by(candidate) %>%
    summarize(ecv = sum(ecv)) %>%  # Sum the ECVs per candidate
    ungroup()
}

# Example Historical Data
historical_data <- data.frame(
  year = c(2000, 2000, 2000, 2000, 2000),
  state = c("alabama", "alaska", "arizona", "arkansas", "california"),
  candidate = c("Bush", "Bush", "Bush", "Bush", "Gore"),
  votes = c(941173, 167398, 781652, 472940, 4567429),
  ecv = c(9, 3, 8, 6, 54)
)

# Example District Data (Placeholder)
district_data <- data.frame(
  year = c(2000, 2000, 2000, 2000, 2000),
  state = c("alabama", "alaska", "arizona", "arkansas", "california"),
  district = c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1),  # Just placeholder data for a single district
  candidate = c("Bush", "Bush", "Bush", "Bush", "Gore"),
  votes = c(941173, 167398, 781652, 472940, 4567429),
  ecv = c(9, 3, 8, 6, 54)
)

# Apply Allocation Strategies
state_wide_results <- state_wide_winner_take_all(historical_data)
district_wide_results <- district_wide_winner_take_all(historical_data, district_data)
state_wide_proportional_results <- state_wide_proportional(historical_data)
national_proportional_results <- national_proportional(historical_data)

# Function to Compare Results
compare_results <- function(actual, state_wide, district_wide, state_proportional, national_proportional) {
  list(
    actual = actual,
    state_wide = state_wide,
    district_wide = district_wide,
    state_proportional = state_proportional,
    national_proportional = national_proportional
  )
}

# Compare Results
results <- compare_results(historical_data, state_wide_results, district_wide_results, state_wide_proportional_results, national_proportional_results)
print(results)

```

The output is a list of the results for each allocation strategy compared to the actual historical election data, showing the total ECVs per candidate under each strategy.

State-Wide Winner-Take-All method often aligns with the actual historical results since it is the most commonly used method.

State-Wide Proportional tends to distribute ECVs more evenly, potentially reducing the impact of swing states.

National Proportional ensures that the national popular vote is more closely reflected in the ECV distribution, which could favor candidates with broader national appeal.

These findings illustrate how different ECV allocation strategies can influence the outcome of presidential elections. Each method has its own implications and can favor different candidates depending on the distribution of votes.

#### Fact Check: Evaluating the Fairness of Different ECV Allocation Schemes

##### Fairest Allocation Scheme

The **National Proportional Allocation** is considered the fairest because it reflects the national popular vote, ensuring each vote has equal weight.

##### Comparison of Allocation Schemes

1.  **State-Wide Winner-Take-All**: Often aligns with historical results. In 2000, it resulted in George W. Bush winning.
2.  **District-Wide Winner-Take-All + State-Wide "At Large" Votes**: Can lead to different outcomes, especially in states with mixed representation.
3.  **State-Wide Proportional**: Distributes ECVs more evenly, reducing the impact of swing states.
4.  **National Proportional**: Reflects the national popular vote. In 2000, Al Gore would have won.

##### Impact on the 2000 Election

-   **State-Wide Winner-Take-All**: Bush wins with 271 ECVs.
-   **District-Wide Winner-Take-All + State-Wide "At Large" Votes**: Likely favors Bush.
-   **State-Wide Proportional**: Closer result, possibly favoring Gore.
-   **National Proportional**: Gore wins, reflecting his popular vote victory.

#### Conclusion

The **National Proportional Allocation** scheme is the fairest, as it accurately reflects the popular vote. In the 2000 election, this method would have resulted in Al Gore winning, highlighting the significant impact different ECV allocation methods can have on election outcomes.
